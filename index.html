                <p>
                    ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                    was born on October 15, 1931, in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>

                    of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>

                    aeronautical engineering from the
                    Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958 joined the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
                    ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation, where he
                    was project director of the SLV-III, the
                    first satellite launch vehicle that was
                    both designed and produced in India.
                    <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                    Kalam planned the program that produced
                    a number of successful missiles, which
                    helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                        “Missile Man.”</strong>
                    <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
                    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                    in 1989.
                    <br><br> ☛ He also played a
                    pivotal organisational, technical,
                    and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                    nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                    the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                    <br><br> ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                    was scientific adviser to the defense
                    minister, and he later served as principal
                    scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                    government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                    <br><br> ☛ His prominent role in
                    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                    solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the tests caused great concern
                    in the international community.
                    <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
                    forward a countrywide plan called
                    Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                    as a road map for transforming India from
                    a less-developed to a developed society
                    in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                    other measures, increasing agricultural
                    productivity, emphasizing technology as
                    a vehicle for economic growth, and
                    widening access to health care and
                    education.
                    <br><br> ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b>

                    to the Government.
                    <br><br> ☛ In 1997, Kalam received
                    India's highest civilian honour, the
                    Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
                    the scientific research and modernisation
                    of defence technology in India.
                    <br><br> ☛ In 2013, he was the

                    excellence in the management and leadership
                    of a space-related project".
                    <br><br> ☛ While delivering a
                    lecture at the Indian Institute of
                    Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                    died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
                    <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
                    <br><br> ☛ Wheeler Island, a
                    national missile test site in Odisha, was

                    <br><br> ☛ A prominent road in

                    in August 2015.
                    <br><br> ☛ In February 2018,
                    scientists from the Botanical Survey
                    of India named a newly found plant
